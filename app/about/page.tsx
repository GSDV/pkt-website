                <div className='pText'>
                    There is never a dull day at the Beta Delta chapter in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign! Our brothers are heavily involved in the student organizations on campus and the overall Champaign community. The chapter itself hosts multiple workshops, both professional ones and social ones. The professional workshops center around career development. Amongst our most popular and effective are the LinkedIn Workshop, Finance Workshop, and Internship Workshop. The more social, fun workshops are hosted by brothers who have an interest they want to share with the chapter.
